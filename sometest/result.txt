"Now, with the popularity of mobile phone, many people stay up late playing mobile phone, we college students is the main force, more and more people are late, they happy talk with QQ, or a brush with micro-blog, remember Baoqiang Wang in micro-blog broke out, visited Sina instantly soared, many people have seen don't sleep."
"However, this has brought many problems, needless to say, if sleep will not only play, get up late, the day will be sleepy, which are fatal regardless of learning or work, because there is no efficiency, no amount of time will not get good results. So we need to get rid of it."
"So, how can you change this bad habit, in my opinion, the best way is to supervise each other, and also can be good friends to get rid of the bad habit of making treaties, such as a few points on time every night sleep, exercise, gradually reduce the time playing mobile phone before going to bed and so on, after all, self supervision in the first time too hard. Twenty-one days to develop a habit, as long as the stick down, and then want to sleep late will be very uncomfortable."
